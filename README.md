# TipAssist Website

An interactive and responsive website created to assist restaurant servers and bartenders with tipping out other restaurant staff by automating a majority of the process. Users can either chose to use a preset tipout format with preset tipout percentages  or create their own custom one.

## NOTE:

Not all commits are listed in this repository. The first commit is when the website was a little over 50% done. This is because when I first started the website, it was in a repo with multiple other projects. Due to this, I wasn't able to use Github Pages to host the website, since for that you need a seperate repo just for the website code. So i created this repo, with the first commit being about a little over 50% of the final website. Beacuse of this, there was some loss of the documented progression of creating this website.

## Current State:
Currently, the website is fully responsive, featuring a functional navbar that adjusts to a hamburger menu based on the screen size. The site consists of several sections, including a home section, features section, try-now section, and creator section. While the majority of my time and code were dedicated to the functionality of the try-now section, the remaining sections primarily serve visual purposes and lack JavaScript functionality.

The try-now section is the main focus point of this website. It incorporates a role selector, allowing users to choose between the Bartender or Server role, as the tipout menu varies depending on the selected role. Additionally, there is a tipout format dropdown menu that provides preset tipout formats for users to choose from. At present, the available options are "custom" and "fids" (which corresponds to the restaurant I work at). Once a format is selected, the "input" tipout menu is displayed, where users enter their sales for the respective night. The inputs in this menu differ based on the chosen role. Once all the required fields are filled, users can click the Calculate button, which opens a "calculated" tipout menu, presenting the tipout amounts for each position that the selected role is required to tipout, based on the entered information.


## Future Features:
In the future, I plan to introduce additional features to enhance the functionality of the website. These features will include more preset tipout formats and greater flexibility in customizing the tipout menus. Currently, the tipout menu format closely aligns with the tipout process at the restaurant where I work. However, I recognize that employees from different restaurants may have varying tipout procedures, making it challenging for them to utilize the website effectively. To address this, I want to make the tipout menus adaptable to different restaurants and their unique tipout structures.

One significant feature that I plan on implementing is a tipout history for users. This will involve the creation of user accounts, enabling individuals to log in and access a dedicated section displaying their complete tipout history. The history will include details such as the dates of tipouts, the amounts distributed to each position, the recipients of the tipouts, the utilized percentages, and more. This feature will provide users with a convenient and organized record of their tipout activities. Additionally, I plan on implementing a specialized account option for food runners, bussers, and other relevant roles involved in the tipout process. These accounts will provide the positions with access to information pertaining to the tipout amounts they received. This will enable them to easily track their earnings and stay informed about the tips they have been allocated.
