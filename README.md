# TipAssist Website

An interactive and responsive website created to assist restaurant servers and bartenders with tipping out other restaurant staff by automating a majority of the process. Users can either chose to use a preset tipout format with preset tipout percentages  or create their own custom one.

### NOTE: Not all commits are listed in this repository. The first commit is when the website was a little over 50% done. This is because when I first started the website, it was in a repo with multiple other projects. Due to this, I wasn't able to use Github Pages to host the website, since for that you need a seperate repo just for the website code. So i created this repo, with the first commit being about a little over 50% of the final website. Beacuse of this, there was some loss of the documented progression of creating this website.
